CRITICAL - App-Breaking Issues
‚ùå REACT SYNTAX ERROR - App Won't Load

File: src/pages/ResearchCommunities.tsx (lines 249-250)
Issue: Two extra closing </div> tags causing "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag" error
Impact: The entire app crashes on load with a white screen
Fix Needed: Remove the duplicate closing tags on lines 249-250
‚ùå Missing API Endpoints - 500/404 Errors

Issue: Routes defined in App.tsx but backend endpoints don't exist:
/api/communities (GET, POST)
/api/communities/:id/join (POST)
/api/communities/:id/leave (POST)
Impact: All community features fail, console shows 500/404 errors
Files Affected: ResearchCommunities.tsx, TrendingResearch.tsx, LearningPaths.tsx, ResearchTools.tsx
‚ùå Missing Page Components

Issue: App.tsx imports pages that likely don't exist or are incomplete:
TrendingResearch.tsx
LearningPaths.tsx
ResearchTools.tsx
PrivacyPolicy.tsx
TermsOfService.tsx
About.tsx, HowItWorks.tsx, Contact.tsx, FAQ.tsx
Impact: Navigation to these routes will fail
HIGH PRIORITY - Functional Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Not Persistent

Issue: Backend workflow keeps failing/dying (status: FAILED in logs)
Impact: Registration and all API calls intermittently fail
Root Cause: Process management issue with workflow system
‚ö†Ô∏è No Error Boundaries

Issue: When React errors occur, entire app crashes with no recovery
Impact: Poor user experience, no graceful degradation
‚ö†Ô∏è Database Schema Mismatch

Issue: Frontend expects features (communities, trending, learning paths) that aren't in the database schema
Impact: Features can't work without proper data models
MEDIUM PRIORITY - UX/Design Issues
üì± Incomplete Homepage

Footer links navigate to non-existent or incomplete pages
Missing "Communities", "Trending", "Learning Paths", "Research Tools" functionality
üîç No Loading States

Pages don't show loading indicators during API calls
Creates confusion when data is being fetched
‚ùó Poor Error Handling

API errors only logged to console
No user-facing error messages for failed operations
LOW PRIORITY - Technical Debt
üìù Incomplete User Profile

ORCID integration not fully implemented
No profile picture support
Missing research interests/expertise tags
üîê No Email Verification

Users can register with any email
No password reset mechanism
üìä No Analytics/Metrics

Can't track paper views, downloads, or engagement
